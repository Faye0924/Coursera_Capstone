The eight major traditions of Chinese cuisine are: Shandong cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Fujian cuisine, Jiangsu cuisine, Zhejiang cuisine, Hunan cuisine, Anhui cuisine. Let along other traditional cuisine. In Foursquare, there are also Chinese restaurants belong to different categories, such as dim sum restaurants, dumpling restaurant, etc.  \n",
